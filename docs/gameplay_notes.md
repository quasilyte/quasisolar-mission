## Building Star Bases

The player can build new star bases.

Requirements:

* The system should be unoccupied (i.e. it has no other star bases)
* Fleet should have at least 1 Ark vessel

If these requirements are satisfied, "build star base" action will be available.

Since Ark is essentially a ship that transforms into a base, it takes no extra time to build it.

After the base is created, Ark ship leaves the fleet (in other words, it's consumed).

A new base starts with a 1st level and no garrison.
