## Ravagers faction

An alien race of unknown origins. It's a minor faction that can
only be interacted in limited ways.

It's not possible to find their star bases or fleets around the map normally.
They do however appear in some random events.

It looks like they don't know the Wertu universal language, which can
imply that they avoided the contact or entered this region of space after
the initial Wertu campaing.

Their attempts to communicate can look like a static noise which
makes the conventional equipment unsuitable for a conversation.
Although it's never clear whether they actually tried to communicate
or their goal is to confuse their opponent.

Canonically, they suffer a defeat during the first offense
with Earthlings after which they start to plan a retaliation.
They offer to solve this issue once and for all in 1-on-1 battle
to reduce the casualties from both sides. However, the player can
reject this duel and perform a normal fleet-vs-fleet battle.

The Ravager vessel is a medium-sized battle vessel that is well-known
for its lack of ability to carry any shields. The ravagers compensate that
by utilizing their special weapon: the Tempest. The Tempest is both
an offense and defense mechanism. Fighting with ravagers opens a
possibility to research the Tempest weapon.
