All events are happening in an alternative universe.

We still have a Human race that comes from the planet Earth ("Earthlings"),
but the homeworld is called "Quasisolar system" instead of "Solar system".

> Note! "Map" snapshots do not show all alien races; only ones that are more or less introduced into the game.

# Events preceding the beginning of the game

## Year 2050

Earthlings are still struggling with their own star system exploration.

No alien contacts happened at this point.

Other races that are native to this part of the galaxy mostly visit their
neighbor systems, they're too far away from the Quasisolar system to learn about
the Earthlings existence (or they don't care enough to introduce themself to
a race that doesn't ever leave its own homeworld).

## Year 2052

The Wertu race enters our region of space.

They fly from one system to another, establishing a diplomatic relationships
with local sentient beings.

They might look noble, but the results of their activity
is a vast expansion of their own territories.

Some races (Zyth, for instance) tried to keep them away from their borders, but
Wertu technologies and the fleet size were superior.

Humans made a first extraterrestrial life contact during this year.
Wertu were impressed by the AI research progress humans made.

In a year or two, Wertu was the faction that controlled most of the star systems.

## Year 2055

A new race discovered these realms.

Krigia was different from Wertu, although their goals were almost identical.
They took star systems by a crude force, eradicating entire races in the process.

There was only one thing that slowed their expansion down: Wertu.

## Year 2058

After a three years of battles, Wertu started to lose its grounds.

They contacted Earthlings with a proposal. Wertu would provide a technology
that would allow humans to travel between star systems while humans would
supply them with AI-controlled vessels.

It was a great offer, but there was a catch. As it turned out, humans can't
survive the jump between two star systems.

People started to work on a solution that would help them to overcome this limitation.

## Year 2060

The combined forces of the Earhlings, Wertu and some other races were still not
enough to fend the Krigia off, but the balance of power was almost perfect:
neither side could get an upper hand.

To resolve this situation, Krigia promised to permit keeping all currently
occupied star systems of every race that would stay out of this conflict.
Since this war caused a lot of devastations, all races eventually accepted these
conditions; even the Earthlings.

The worst news for humans was, of course, whey could never leave the Quasisolar
system now: they never controlled any other star systems apart from it.

## Year 2061

With the balance favoring Krigia, Wertu lost most of their systems.

This was a third year of the special project humans started after they got
the inter-system jumps technology.

Instead of sending the humans, we would send fully automated vessels.

The flagship would contain a prototype, one-of-the-kind supercomputer
that would control these automated vessels. It was designed to have a perfect human
behavior replica, so it can represent the human race far away from our reach.

With this strategy, humans gained an ability to visit other star systems without Wertu supervision.

## Year 2062

It was never clear whether Krigia would keep their promise and leave
the remaining races be after their big battle will be finished.

Earthlings had a choice: either to wait until it's over and see for
themselves or try to enter this conflict with this new ability of
flying from one star system to another. They could build new star bases,
form new alliances and defeat the invaders.

People of Earth decided to violate the Krigia agreement and leave the system.

This is where you join the game.

## The player

You play as a supercomputer that controls the Earthlings flagship.

You are the only thing that can fly between the star systems on the humans behalf.

Your choices affect how the other races would perceive the human race.

## The Quasisolar Mission

As long as humans can't leave the Quasisolar system, they can't have any
real chances in standing their ground in the long run.

As a consequence of this, if the player loses Quasisolar system star base,
humans are considered to be extinct. It doesn't result in a game over, but it
will be reported in the end-game credits. All star bases created by the player
are automated, controlled by machines.

Your primary mission is to recover as much alien artifacts as possible
to provide the research material that could be vital for the development
of the better inter-system jumps method that is suitable for human beings.

## The Krigia Flagship

If Wertu information is true, there is a flagship that Krigia plans to use
for doing the finishing blow. Escorted by a big number of elite vessels,
this battle group would give us no chance if we're not prepared when the moment comes.

We predict that it will enter this part of the space in a few years.

> Gameplay note: this "arrival" delay depends on the game difficulty settngs.
> The formal game goal is to defeat this final Krigia unit.
> All other actions will affect the ending the player would get.

# Races info

## Vespion

A carnivorous, xenophobic race that has hard times communicating with other
sentient races that may resemble them their preys.

During the Wertu invasion, they attacked their fleets, protecting their own
territories. They avoided their attempts to form any kind of agreement. Due to
their unwillingness to cooperate, Wertu cornered the Vespion fleet and restricted
their freedom by force.

When the Krigia showed up, Wertu grip on them got weaker and they continued to
explore the nearby space regions.

Somewhere around the year of 2059 they got contacted by Wertu with an alliance
offer to join forces against the common enemy. Vespion declined the offer.

Krigia saw Vespion as insignificant side and never granted them any "promise of
keeping their systems". So they suffered from the Krigia fire as much as anyone else
involved in the conflict.

It's known that for the moment when the game starts, they only control one
star system that is not even their homeworld (which was already obliterated by Krigia).

In the in-game events, there is a quest line that can make Vespion an alied race.

### Alliance with Vespion

A first step would be to find their last holding star system before it gets destroyed.

It can be found by luck or by information coming from a "Vespion Distress Call" event
that would reveal the star system location.

Upon entering a star system, there is a scripted encounter where player can help
the Vespion fleet to destroy the Krigia attackers.

If succeeded, the diplomatic screen with Vespion will become available.
With a set of right phrases player can convince Vespion to form
an alliance with Earthlings.

Note that this is only possible because they see a non-carbon life forms,
they would probably never reach this level of communication with humans.

If we imagine a star map as a 4x2 sector grid, their system appears somewhere
in the middle (where `x` means that it's a location candidate):

```
[ ][x][x][ ]
[ ][x][x][ ]
```
